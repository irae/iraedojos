IraÃª Dojos
======
A repository to share the coding dojo sessions that I had attended

Dojo List
--------

1. [javascriptWaterFlow](http://github.com/irae/iraedojos/tree/master/javascriptWaterFlow) - attended 2010-01-29 @cpartybr - I've made an Javascript equivalent to the main code developed in Java by the team.

About
--------

I pretend to share the source code from all dojo sessions I eventually attend in the future. I hope that this code could be useful for someone someday.

What is a coding dojo?

I've just participated in my first coding dojo session, it's better that other explain it to you:
